# My Excel Data Analytics Projects

This repo contains two projects that I implemented as part of the course [Excel for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/products/excel-for-data-analytics/).  

## Salary Dashboard  

In this project we have created a dashboard to help job seekers investigate salaries fro their desired jobs and ensure they are being adequately compensated.
